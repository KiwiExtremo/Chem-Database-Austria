# Chem-Database-Austria
A webpage made to handle queries to a database of chemical products.

This webpage is part of the ERASMUS PROJECT: Chemical database and UI. It was done in 2 months by students Ariel GÃ³mez (me), Pol Villar, and Edgar Montero.

Pol and I designed the database, and then Pol took the design and assembled it on Oracle, then imported it into MariaDB, our chosen database management system.
I handled all the webpage UI and backend, connected to the database to update it in real time. We don't talk about Edgar's part (Android app).

The project has been coded to be used on a localhost (using XAMPP), so changes should be done to the db_conn.php file if anyone wants to use a different server.

There is a user manual that explains how to import the database, and how the webpage works.
